This code is meant for collecting Twitter data on your list of verified accounts, which will be put in real_people.csv, and fake accounts, which will be put in fake_people.csv

To run this code, place the account names, one line per account, in both files.
Add Twitter Application Keys to stream.py,stream_foll.py, fo/foll_find.py.
The code is currently designed to work with 8 apps, 4 for each list. If you use more or less, adjust the list spilts accordingly.
Run using:
./run.sh

Keep in mind that this will take a long..long while, so reserve resources accordingly.
